# Mood-based-song-recommendation-system

People experience all sorts of emotions throughout the day, and the Mood-Based Song Recommendation Web application strives to uplift or complement these feelings by recommending a song. The mood tracker web app allows people to be more in touch with their emotions and how they feel on a day-to-day basis, while also reflecting on how they felt in the past week or month while listening to a cool new song.
